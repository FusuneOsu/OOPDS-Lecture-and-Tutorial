// Problem #1: Date
// 1) Design a class called Date that has integer data members to store month, day, and year.
// 2) The class should have a three-parameter default constructor that allows the date to be set at the
// time a new Date object is created. If the user creates a Date object without passing any
// arguments, or if any of the values passed are invalid, the default values of 1, 1, 2001 (i.e.,
// January 1, 2001) should be used.
// 3) The class should have member functions to print the date in the following formats:
// 3/15/16
// March 15, 2016
// 15 March 2016
// 4) Demonstrate the class by writing a program that uses it. Be sure your program only accepts
// reasonable values for month and day. The month should be between 1 and 12. The day should
// be between 1 and the number of days in the selected month.

// Problem #2: Report Heading
// 1) Design a class called Heading that has data members to hold the company name and the report
// name.
// 2) A two-parameter default constructor should allow these to be specified at the time a new
// Heading object is created.
// 3) If the user creates a Heading object without passing any arguments, "ABC Industries" should be
// used as a default value for the company name and "Report" should be used as a default for the
// report name.
// 4) The class should have member functions to print a heading in either one-line format, as shown
// here:
// Pet Pals Payroll Report
// or in four-line "boxed" format, as shown here:
// ********************************************************
// Pet Pals
// Payroll Report
// ********************************************************
// 5) Try to figure out a way to center the headings on the screen, based on their lengths.
// 6) Demonstrate the class by writing a simple program that uses it.
