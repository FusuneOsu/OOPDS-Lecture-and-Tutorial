// Design and implement four classes Staff, Hospital, Department and Address.
// 1. Create a class named Staff with at least the following data members
// (id, name, birthdate, education, certification, address, and main
// language).
// 2. Design a proper Address class that stores and manipulates the address
// elements.
// 3. The Hospital class must have at least the following members (Name as a
// string, Address as an Address object, phone, fax, e-mail, an array of
// departments, and any fields you feel necessary)
// 4. The Department class has at least the following members (name, an
// array of Staff, number of staff, and any number of data fields you
// find necessary).
// 5. In the main function:
// a. Create 7 Address objects and initialize them with some data.
// b. Create 6 objects of Staff and initialize them with data of your
// choice. Add an address object to each staff object created.
// c. Create 2 department objects. Add the first 3 Staff objects to
// the first department object and the last three to the second
// department.
// d. Create an object of type Hospital. Initialize the address of the
// hospital to the 7th address. Add the two departments to the
// hospital.
// e. Display all the components you created with proper functions and
// messages.
